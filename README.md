<h3>First react app full project</h3>

<p>

This is my first project utilizing react.js and creating a full-stack website.<br/>
The project is a Video games recommendation, with the option to search, filter, and save games to the user list.<br/>
The project is not using a database, but I might add it in the future.<br/>
The site was deployed using firebase.<br/>
